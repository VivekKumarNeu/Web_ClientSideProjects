<h2> A community cafe serving home cooked, locally sourced, organic food </h2>
<p> With stunning views of the ocean, Example Cafe offers the perfect
environment to unwind and recharge the batteries. </p>
<p> Our menu offers a wide range of breakfasts, brunches and lunches,
including a range of vegetarian options. </p>
<p> Whether you sip on a fresh, hot coffee or a cooling smoothie, you
never need to feel rushed - relax with friends or just watch
the world go by. </p>
<h2> This weekendâ€™s special brunch </h2>
<p> This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg
on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is
that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than
four eggs in the pan at a time. </p>
